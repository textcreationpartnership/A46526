         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:30329:37"/>Therefore our aim is ſtill at the heart, as knowing that unleſſe it be pierced and wounded, ſin ſtill lives in you, and like a <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>venemous</hi> root, or <hi>corrupt ſpring,</hi> will ever be ſprouting and ſending out bitter fruit and muddy waters: but if the heart once be ſavingly wounded, mortified, cleanſed, we know the outward man and converſation will ſoon be reformed, as when the root is deaded, the fruit and leaves fall of themſelves, and the branches wither: if the fountain be once ſtopt, the ſtreams ſoon dry up.<note place="margin">which makes them not ſo eager againſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage and faſhions of men always.</note> Will you then <hi>know why</hi> wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Preachers do not in their Reproofs inſiſt ſo much and ſo long and frequently at leaſt in inveighing againſt mens wearing of <hi>long hair,</hi> womens <hi>cut locks,</hi> men and womens gariſhneſſe in their attire and faſhions, geſtures, and outward unſeemly behaviour, ſome kindes of ſports, and abuſe of lawful ſports? Is it becauſe they allow and applaud you in ſuch things? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe: make not that ill uſe of our ſilence, or more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reproofs. But know, the true reaſon hereof is, becauſe we are aſſured that if theſe things were outwardly reformed, and yet the heart not touched or pricked, they like <hi>Samſon</hi>'s hair once clipt, would ſoon grow again: the heart not <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> all vice would be ſprouting again: yea, to cry out againſt ſuch things, and not to convince the heart of the ſinfulneſſe and danger of them, would never have any good effect. Nay, we may, I know, as well hope to rob a bear of her whelps, as to make you leave ſuch faſhions, ſo long as your hearts are ſet thereon: experience ſhews it. No arguments, perſwaſions, diſſwaſives, threatnings, though out of Gods Word, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men to leave ſuch faſhions and cuſtoms, till the heart be wounded and pierced. And when this is done, all theſe will, in great part, fall of themſelves, and people will not be aſhamed to be out of the common and corrupt faſhions and cuſtoms of the time. Give us leave then to preach ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and make ſuch Applications as may be as <hi>hammers</hi> ſhall I ſay? yea, as <hi>goads</hi> and <hi>nails,</hi> as pricks and the point of a ſword to prick your hearts, and to touch you even in your beſt beloved ſins, that ſo we may take your hearts from off them, and make them bitter and loathſom to you. The heart muſt indeed firſt be humbled, and then there will follow mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30329:38"/>in outward things, and reformation of life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the outward behaviour will ſuit well with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition of the humbled heart; the heart, as the firſt or maſter-wheel in the clock, being well ſet, will order both the tongue, as the bell, and converſation and outward behaviour, as the hand and pointer: there will be a conſonancie among them. Let no man then deceive himſelf, and tell me he thanks God his heart is good to God ward, and he hath a good heart and meaning, howſoever he outwardly frame to the times and common cuſtoms of the world: if the heart were ſo good as is pretended, the hand, tongue, eye, and generally the whole outward converſation would not be ſo diſſonant, at leaſt ſo much and ſo conſtantly, as is in many who yet brag much of that which few ſees, of their good hearts.</p>
                  <p>Now as ſaving Converſion muſt begin at the heart, ſo it would not be much out of our way to <hi>obſerve,</hi> that it, and all the conſequents of it, all the <hi>comforts</hi> of a regenerate condition, and all the happineſſe of heaven,<note place="margin">All Comforts begin with ſome ſorrow, as All Sin ends in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> begins with pricking and wounding, with ſorrow and compunction. Wherein God is contrary to the devil, the world, and ſin, which make offer and promiſe of much pleaſure, gain and honour at the firſt; and men finde ſome ſuch like thing at firſt, as gives content to their ſenſual deſires and corrupt taſte: but all at the laſt ends in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe and ſorrow endleſſe and eaſeleſſe: Neither do ſuch things long enjoyed,<note place="margin">See this in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> Luke 16.25.</note> give that content they promiſed; as on the other ſide, ſuch as make trial of the ways of God, finde much more content in and comfort from them, then they could have expected, finding themſelves to have been worſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid then hurt.

                  <hi>how theſe Converts here upon Peters Sermon came thus to be pricked?</hi> I anſwer: They (God opening their hearts as he did <hi>Lydia's</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) came, upon <hi>Peters</hi> wiſe and skilfull handling and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſharp ſword of the ſpirit, or word of God, (which <hi>pierceth to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit</hi> and by piercing pricketh) at once to ſee and be convinced within themſelves <hi>of their ſinne</hi> againſt Chriſt in crucifying of him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Generall.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>of Gods wrath</hi> thereupon and vengeance hanging over their heads, and of their own juſt damnation, and hereupon were pricked in heart, ſtruck with fear, &amp; made ſorrowful. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged them that they were the crucifiers of Chriſt, they knew well and remembred that they indeed had deſired <hi>Pilate</hi> to crucifie him, and now hearing (and by ſuch apparant ſignes from heaven as on that day, which in ſome degree had aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them all) <hi>ſeeing</hi> a divine power therein and being told that it was <hi>Jeſus</hi> now exalted to glory,<note place="margin">

Even as <hi>Pauls</hi> conſcience was touched a little after he had reviled the high Prieſt, when once he came to know him ſo to be,<note place="margin">Act. 23.5.</note> but much more when he came firſt to know Chriſt, and that it was he, even the Lord of glory whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in his ignorance and unbelief, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.5.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>

Now they look upon him whom they had peirced and ſee him whom they ſlew to be one who being Lord of heaven and earth, was able, (yea for ought they then ſaw) ready to deſtroy them in ſouls and bodies, and therefore they tremble.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">They came thus to be pricked by reaſoning within themſelves.</note>Now this was done by a kind of reaſoning with themſelves and communing with their own hearts by a practicall ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme; The <hi>Propoſition</hi> whereof the Law written in their hearts, and word of God afforded them; in effect this: <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,</hi> eſpecially of their Saviour, and of the Lord of life, <hi>are under the curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>and no murtherer (or none that hates his brother) hath eternall life abiding in him, John</hi> 3.15. <hi>But ſaith
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30329:39"/>Peter</hi> and their own conſciences, We are murtherers, and that even of Chriſt: then follows the <hi>concluſion,</hi> Therefore we are under the curſe, and debarred of life.</p>
               <p>Now out of this concluſion made by conſcience, follows in the affections, fear, deſpair in themſelves, ſorrow, horrour, and perplexity, in a word, wounding and pricking, and it is as when an evil doer, a ſecure ſinner, thief or murtherer,<note place="margin">Out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of which ſyllogiſine iſſued this <hi>pricking.</hi>
                  </note> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and brought to the barre, where the Judge giving the charge, declares what is Law, what ſinnes and crimes are againſt Law and by Law deſerve death: after which the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour is accuſed of ſuch crimes as deſerve death, and by ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient witneſſe proved to be guilty, and he himſelf cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the fact: whereupon the Judge paſſeth ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and of death: at which the party is ſtricken with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and pricked at heart as with the point of a ſword. Such is the work of conſcience in ſinners, the ſame conſcience being as a <hi>Law</hi> to inlighten and to judge generally of good and evil, it is alſo a <hi>witneſſe</hi> to convince, and laſtly a <hi>Judge</hi> to give ſentence againſt it ſelf, and ſo to terrifie.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with theſe Jews: and no otherwiſe it is with other Converts, as comes now to be ſhewed, ſo that looking on this pricking of heart, as the beginning of, or firſt ſtep to converſion, we do raiſe and make this Generall obſervation following, namely that,</p>

                        <hi>2</hi> It holds not on the contrary, that all that are pricked in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall be converted.</note>2 I do not ſay on the contrary that all ſuch as are pricked in conſcience or troubled for ſinne, are therefore or ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be converted or ſaved, unleſſe their trouble proceed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and to ſuch a degree of contrition as to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth belong, and may be proved otherwiſe in regard of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces concomitant to be ſaving: of which trialls and meaſure of ſaving ſorrow hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Much more then a bare legall terrour of conſcience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works are required in true Converts.</p>
                  <p>That the Impenitent, wicked and reprobate may be pricked, It is plain: All come not to it, as being given over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind and ſhut up in hardneſſe of heart; yet many who come to it yet go no further, and ſo they miſcarry in the end: as we ſee in King <hi>Ahab,</hi> who was humbled when he heard of Gods judgement for killing of <hi>Naboth,</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30329:40"/>ſo in King <hi>Saul</hi> who was pricked and relented after he had wronged <hi>David,</hi>

                        <hi>King</hi> Saul.</note> and yet ſaw <hi>Davids</hi> integrity, yea he wept, and yet returned to that ſinne of perſecuting him. So many after their ſinne of dunkenneſſe, whoring, murther, have no doubt ſome legall qualmes of conſcience, ſome fits, ſome ſtirrings and ſtingings thereof, but no more, as we ſee in <hi>Felix,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Felix. Acts. 24.25.</note> who hearing <hi>Paul</hi> reaſon of righteouſneſſe, temperance and Judgement to come, trembled: yet he ſhuffled off the matter and continued in his unrighteouſnes, Intemperance as we may well deem, &amp; in his ſecurity without fear of Gods judgements: otherwiſe he would neither have expected mony as a bribe that he might looſe <hi>Paul,</hi> nor yet have left him bound to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie others. And what think we of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> both which confeſſed their ſin to be great,<note place="margin">Cain.

And as we have heard before, divers of the Jews who heard <hi>Stephen</hi> preach to them and charge them with the death of Chriſt, as theſe here were charged by <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeemed to be more then pricked,<note place="margin">Acts 7.52.54</note> they were <hi>cut to the heart</hi> through the accuſations and convictions of the word, yet they ſought not to the remedy as theſe here, but ſtoned <hi>Stephen</hi> and ſo increaſed their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

                        <hi>3</hi> From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is ſuch a change, as a man cannot but be ſenſible of it, firſt or laſt.</note>3 This brings us to conſider of the <hi>nature</hi> of converſion, which implyeth as much as I intend, which being a change from darkneſſe to light, from bondage to liberty, in a word from one contrary to another, how ſhould a man diſcern of his contrary new eſtate without feeling in ſome meaſure the horrour of his former condition under darkneſſe and bondage? at leaſt he can have no comfort in his Converſion unleſſe he find and feel a difference between the one eſtate and the other, which cannot be felt without ſome ſhaking and affrightment: as he apprehends the greatneſſe of the benefit of his deliverance by Chriſt, ſo is he touched with a proportionable fence of his danger, either imminent or paſſed: as we have heard of ſome who having at firſt in their ſleep, drink, or otherwiſe ignorance paſſed ſome very great danger, as over ſome narrow, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and crackt bridge, pit, or the like, being brought after to ſee their danger, they have quaked, trembled, been amazed, if they have not wholly expired and given up the Ghoſt. Thus ſuch as perhaps at the very firſt are not ſo ſenſible of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition, or yet of their change as others are, Chriſt being truly in them, yet afterwards when they come to better conſideration and deeper apprehenſion of their wayes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dangers, they find a proportionable meaſure of inward trouble, terrour, yea and grief for ſuch their hainous offences
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30329:44"/>whereof they were not ſo ſenſible before: and ſo they have their portion of terrour firſt or laſt, in leſſe, or greater meaſure.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 We heard but now that ſome have more ſtout and ſturdy natures then others; and hard and knotty wood muſt have a hard wedge.

                     <hi>Again,</hi> ſome men are <hi>puffed</hi> up with high conceits of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in regard of their gifts, parts, places and high callings, which keep many from hearkening to any ordinary means and motives which are uſed to humble them, and ſo indeed wholy from Converſion. Now if God intend the Converſion of ſuch, he deales with them commonly after a rougher manner, ſeeing a ſmall thing will not tame their lofty, fierce and fiery ſpirits: ſo he took down <hi>Paul,</hi> yea ſtruck him down by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible apparition and audible voice from heaven, when being highly conceited of his own legal righteouſneſſe, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident of the goodneſſe of his cauſe and Profeſſion, in the height of his zeal he was galloping hard on in the way of perſecuting of the Saints of God. On the other hand, many that have not any great matters in them to ſtand upon, and being of meaner rank and eſtimation in the world, have nothing to oppoſe againſt the reproofs of the word, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſimplicity and ſeeming meanneſſe of the Preacher, and ſo are ſooner convinced, and ſtand not in need of ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to tame them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Some have been more <hi>grievous ſinners,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2 Paſt.</hi> having been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>great</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</note> and have run both deeper and longer in <hi>debt</hi> with God then others; they are deeply defiled in ſin, double died; their ſins are ſcarlet ſins, and have taken deeper root in them through cuſtome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and have more poyſoned and corrupted their natures other wiſe bad enough. In which regard if God intend any mercy to ſuch (as indeed his mercy when he pleaſeth to ſhew it, ſhines moſt in ſuch) he more deeply and ſenſibly humbles them then others. When once he opens their eyes to ſee their ſin in the right hue of it, it being of ſo groſſe a nature appears moſt <hi>loathſome</hi> and ugly, and more foul then ſinnes of lower ſtature and growth: and ſo the guilt and conſequently the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof, will lie more heavy upon the ſoul, and preſſe it more down to hell then ſins of leſſe hatefullneſſe, till it pleaſe God in mercy to remove it, and to aſſure them of pardon.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30329:46"/>As ſin brings them deep in <hi>debt</hi> with God, ſo before they get a diſcharge from God, they muſt proportionably <hi>pay</hi> for it, not by way of ſatisfaction, but of humble acknowledgement, whilſt they are made to feel in their own conſciences ſome <hi>weight</hi> of it, proportionable to the greatneſſe of their ſin; (for, the greater the burthen is, the greater will be the pain of the back:) though afterward, finding eaſe, their comfort is alſo anſwerable in meaſure to their former dejections, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much more then theirs who, having not formerly ſinned in like gorſſe manner, finde not it may be at firſt thoſe terrours, yet afterwards in the courſe of their lives, they pay for it; and what they eſcaped at the beginning, they meet withal in their progreſſe, finding an abatement of the others comforts: in which regard, ſome have compared the former ſort to ſuch as <hi>pay a great fine and ſit on a ſmall rent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Simil.</note> the later to ſuch as pay but a little fine, but then their rent is greater.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to paſſe that ſome mens ſins are not ſo eaſily <hi>waſhed</hi> and done away as others are; their <hi>poiſon</hi> not ſo ſoon <hi>purged</hi> out; their <hi>wounds</hi> and feſtered ſores not ſo ſoon <hi>cured:</hi> as ſome ſores may be let out with the pricking of a pin, when others will ſcarce be cured with much and painful launcing and cutting. Some are well <hi>educated,</hi> and brought up in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious families and places where they are watches over,<note place="margin">or better edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and well catechized; where they, for the moſt part, ſee good examples, and are kept from evil and lewd company: Theſe have grace inſtilled into them by degrees, drop by drop; and conſequently, not having laden their conſciences with groſſer ſins, when they come to be convinced of the guilt of original and their other leſſer actual ſins, they are not ſo deeply ſtricken and wounded in heart therewith as others are, who have more given the reins to their luſts, and made a longer trade of ſin. Theſe, as they are more inſenſibly wrought upon by the Law, and ſooner humbled; (herein, as one compares them, like to <hi>Neias hawks,</hi> which being taken out of the neſt,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> though they have a wilde nature, yet are ſooner manned then the <hi>haggards</hi> which have long preyed for themſelves, which muſt be kept from ſleep, hooded, and much pains taken with them ere they be thorowly tamed and brought to the Lure:) ſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30329:47"/>they ſooner make uſe of the remedy, which is of the mercies of God in Chriſt laid hold on by faith, as being well inſtructed in their tender years in the doctrine of <hi>Juſtification by faith,</hi> and of the free grace of Chriſt, which they ſooner apprehend then others, who having lived wicked lives in their ignorance, and not having the knowledge of the Goſpel, are deeplier caſt down, and longer kept under bondage, when once the Law hath faſtned on their conſciences. The like I ſay of ſuch hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as live under ſuch teaching where the Law and Goſpel are not wiſely and intermixedly taught together, but either all Law and terrour and no Goſpel, or very little of it; which ſoon dejects and much terrifieth the conſcience, but not ſo ſoon and hardly (if at all) raiſeth up again: or the Goſpel and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſame without the Law, whereby men are ſoon and much comforted, without any great terror going before; which comfort therefore in many is juſtly to be ſuſpected, men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by turning <hi>Libertines</hi> as well in practice and life, as in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Whereas where both are wiſely taught together, the hearer is no ſooner ſmitten by the Law, but he can look to the promiſe and ſomewhat help himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Laſtly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> to come; as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to greater or leſſer works.</note> if we look to the time to come, we muſt know that ſome are deputed and <hi>deſigned by God to greater works,</hi> ſorer trials, harder ſervices then others; whom accordingly he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares by deeper humiliation: for, as one well ſaith, the higher and greater the building is, the deeper muſt the foundation be laid in the earth: As we ſee in <hi>Moſes,</hi> but eſpecially in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> the one being ſore (though ſuddenly) humbled, the other long tried and humbled before he came to be King. So S. <hi>Auſten</hi> confeſſeth that whereas his friend <hi>Alipius</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his new-birth with little or no ſtrugling, he himſelf found no quietneſſe and victory but after great terrours and conflicts. And ſo no doubt others finde it. Now there may be good <hi>reaſon</hi> for it, ſeeing not onely <hi>Satan</hi> will more ſtrongly oppoſe ſuch in their converſion as he foreſees are likely to be greater enemies then others to his kingdom, but <hi>God</hi> in wiſedom thus deeply humbles them, that ſo giving them <hi>experience</hi> of his goodneſſe, aſſiſtance, as alſo power in delivering them, they might be better <hi>prepared</hi> by faith to undertake, and more <hi>ſecured</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:30329:47"/>againſt all oppoſitions and difficulties in undertaking the greateſt matters and trials which they ſhall be called unto. Thus both <hi>Samſon</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were prepared for great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, the one againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> and both againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> by the experience they both had of Gods aſſiſtance in their buckling with, and maſtering of the lion.</p>
                  <p>And ſo from this different dealing of God with thoſe whom he converts,<note place="margin">From this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dealing of God we obſerve his wiſdome.</note> in that he heath not tied himſelf to one way, we may take notice of the <hi>wiſdome of God</hi> who doth all for his own glory, and for the greater good of his children.</p>

               <p n="1">1 God will in his providence have our hearts to ake by bringing us in ſome meaſure under the ſpirit of bonage, and have us thus wounded, at leaſt pricked before he receive us, for <hi>our own Good,</hi> who otherwiſe would neither <hi>know</hi> our ſelves aright, nor acknowledge our want and need of Chriſt (whilſt we miſſed him not,) nor prize him aright. For methods ſake, know the <hi>good</hi> which God intends his elect by thus deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, is, (according to that uſuall diviſion <hi>of good</hi>) <hi>Profitable, Comfortable, Honourable.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 God thus brings home to himſelf wandring ſinners as he did the <hi>Prodigall,</hi>

               <p>Man naturally is like the wild aſſe colt; or <hi>like the aſſe uſed to the wilderneſſe,</hi>

               <p>This is taught us <hi>Jer.</hi> 31 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love: therefore with loving kindneſſe have I drawn thee.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. and 44. <hi>All that the Father giveth me</hi> (lo, there is Gods <hi>free love</hi>) <hi>ſhall come unto me, &amp;c.</hi> (there is expreſſed the <hi>power</hi> of his grace.) And, <hi>no man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> No man can come to Chriſt but by Gods free grace in love, giving Chriſt as a <hi>ſurety, John</hi> 3.16. and then by power applying him to our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as our <hi>head, Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26.

Onely now I will briefly note thus much: Before the grace of Converſion and Faith be fully wrought, the Spirit works <hi>orderly</hi> by the word, (aſſiſted, as is ſaid, ſometimes by <hi>Miracles, Afflictions</hi> &amp;c.) ſo that there is <hi>firſt</hi> a work of the <hi>Law,</hi> then of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> not but that the Goſpel hath alſo ſome work on the ſoul like unto that of the Law, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo far I refer to the work of the Law, if not of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">There is a double orderly work of Gods power, both of the Law and Goſpel. <hi>1.</hi> By the precept, <hi>Mark. 11.15.</hi>

And this is that <hi>ſpirit of fear,</hi>

Theſe men heal before they hurt; and what ſtings others the faithfull ſervants of God have left in the mindes and conſciences of any, they ſeek to pluck out, and to heal the wound with their oyly words: being like the falſe Prophets of old, of whom, and of the Prieſts it was ſaid, <hi>They have healed the hurt</hi> (bruiſe or breach) <hi>of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace,</hi> Jer. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 14. And when Gods deereſt ſervants tell the people of particular judgements belonging to them, and ſo by wounding and pricking their conſciences bring them on in a good way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repentance, theſe flattering Prophets <hi>ſtrengthen their hands, that they ſhould not return from their wicked wayes, by promiſing them life:</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30329:77"/>of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the ſaving of his houſe,</hi> Hebr. 11.7. So wee read of <hi>Enoch, Jude v.</hi> 7. (though but the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world) who yet ſet the end of the world, or the day of judgement before him, propheſying thereof; whereas ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men through their unbelief never humble themſelves (if then) till judgements be upon them; being herein like ſuch as hearing thunderclaps far off, are not moved till they be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent over their heads, and ſome hurt in their ſight be done: then with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> they tremble, but not till then. So want of faith in Chriſt keeps men from being ſenſible of their ſin, and from being pricked in conſcience for it. When was it that theſe Converts in my Text were pricked in heart? It was when they heard, and withall beleeved that Chriſt whom they crucified was the true Meſſias: So it was foretold <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. that when they <hi>ſhould look upon him whom they had pierced, they ſhould be pierced themſelves, and mourn bitterly,</hi> and be ſenſible of their ſin, which ſhall be fulfilled eſpecially at the converſion of their Nation; but then they muſt <hi>no longer abide in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> Rom. 11.23. Seeing then faith is the gift of God, we muſt earneſtly pray for it, and carefully attend to the miniſtry of the word by which it is begotten. To withdraw from the hearing of the word either in regard of preſence of body, or attention of mind, is to keep our ſelves out of the ſphere and compaſſe, within which onely the word of God, that ſword of the Spirit, is active and operative, and will reach and pierce us.</p>

As, Deep ſleep.

So I have heard and read,<note place="margin">Bewithching.</note> how in the <hi>body of witches</hi> in covenant with the Divel, in the place where by ſucking or otherwiſe he ſets his mark (or Sacramental ſigne) the place is ſo <hi>benummed and deaded;</hi> that a pin of a great largeneſs and length may be thruſt in to the head, without the grief or any ſenſe of the party; by which means, if that mark or bewitched place can be but once found out in the ſuſpected party, it is accounted detection ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. So when a member of the body becomes once to be <hi>gangrained</hi> by exceſſive heat,<note place="margin">Gangrenes.</note> or upon a wound or hurt not looked to in time, it becomes to be void of ſenſe, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of vital heat and ſpirit, to be blaſted, and like wilde-fire (ſome call it S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire) to ſpread, and ſo tends to the deſtruction of the party. So when that uneven ſwelling or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour called a <hi>Cancer</hi> poſſeſſeth any part,<note place="margin">Cancers.</note> that part comes to be black or wan, and without all ſenſe or pain.

Such is the new birth of a ſinner, before hee be made the childe of God.

Prickings of conſcience in ſight and ſenſe of ſin and judgment being ſuffered to have their full work in our deep humiliation, whileſt wee maintain the power of them, and ſeek not eaſe too ſoon, are ſo far from hurting, that they purge us, and draw out our corruption: whereas the ſudden and too haſty healing of them cauſeth the wound to feſter, the ſoul to ſwell with ſelf-conceit and ſecurity, and greater ſorrows (in the end at leaſt) to ſeiſe on it.

It is ſuch comfort as <hi>Job</hi> wanted when he cryed out for and craved pity: <hi>Have pity upon mee, have pity upon mee, O yee my friends; for the hand of God hath touched mee: Why do ye perſecute mee as God? Job</hi> 19.21, 22. and <hi>David,</hi> or rather <hi>Chriſt, Pſalm</hi> 69.20. Secondly, Far be it then for any, in ſtead of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pity, to <hi>perſecute,</hi> condemn,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Not perſecute &amp; cenſure them,</note> and cenſure for hypocrites or otherwiſe, thoſe whom they ſee to labour under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of inward and ſpirituall affliction,<note place="margin">or reproach them,</note> or of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. So <hi>Job</hi>'s pretended friends dealt with him, which made him complain ſo of their cruelty, ſaying,<note place="margin">as yet is done;</note> 
                  <hi>How long will yee vex my ſoul, and break me in pieces with words? Theſe ten times have ye reproached me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">as to <hi>Job,</hi> ſo</note> 
                  <hi>you are not aſhamed that you make your ſelves ſtrange to mee,</hi> (or, <hi>that you harden your ſelves againſt me</hi>) <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. It is matter indeed of <hi>ſhame</hi> to be aſhamed of the afflictions and ſorrows of Gods people, or otherwiſe to reproach them, to caſt ſhame on them, or to become <hi>ſtrange</hi> unto them; whereof <hi>David</hi> ſo complaineth, adding, <hi>When I wept and chaſtened my ſoul with faſting,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>to</hi> David</note> 
                  <hi>that was to my reproach: I made ſack-cloth alſo my garment, and I became a Proverb to them: They that ſit in the gate ſpeak againſt me, and I was the ſong of the drunkards, Pſal.</hi> 69.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Thus it is indeed with men pricked in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:30329:131"/>heart, and humbled in ſoul under Gods hand, that profane and wicked men,<note place="margin">and others in all ages:</note> of all ſorts and ranks, look on them as on monſters, <hi>wondering that they run not with them,</hi> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>to the ſame exceſſe of riot, therefore ſpeaking evill of them,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. Therefore the holy Prophet and Pſalmiſt pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his complaint before the Lord (for he had none elſe to pity him) in this manner; <hi>My heart is ſmitten and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like graſſe: ſo that I forget to eat my bread. By reaſon of the voyce of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin. I am like a Pelican of the wilderneſſe; I am like an Owl of the deſert. I watch, and am as a ſparrow alone upon the houſe top. Mine enemies reproach me all the day: and they that are mad againſt me are ſworn againſt me, Pſalm</hi> 102.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.<note place="margin">and in our own times.</note> Thus we ſee and in experience finde, that if any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtruck and ſavingly wounded in ſpirit by God, withdraw himſelf into his cloſet, ſit alone and keep ſilence, and go hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, and walk mournfully under Gods hand, he is made a <hi>wonder,</hi> and becomes as <hi>an Owl of the deſert:</hi> every one is ready to reproach him, and cenſure him as a deſperate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a fool, as one newly gone mad, and not himſelf; and ſo care not what reproach they lay upon him, jeering and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding them with their much and often hearing of Gods word, ſaying in effect, "I hope you have enough now of "hearing, and of following preciſe teachers, and running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermons, have ye not? And thus their forwardneſſe in good duties ſhall be objected, and (good ſouls) they ſhall be upbraided therewith, and in ſtead of being pitied, prayed for and comforted, they ſhall be cenſured as diſtracted, out of their wits, as ſullen, peeviſh and perverſe people, not fit to live in civill company, able to mar all whom they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe withall.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A Second uſe of exhortation to all, that we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul for ſin in our ſelves, as a thing <hi>1.</hi> Neceſſary. <hi>2.</hi> Seaſonable and befitting <hi>1.</hi> The times, <hi>2.</hi> The perſons. <hi>1.</hi> Of Kings and great ones, <hi>2 Chron. 37.27.</hi> Why?</note> to conclude all, Be we again exhorted all of us, to be ſo far from condemning this mournful diſpoſition in others, that we rather conceive it needfull and neceſſary for our ſelves; ſeeing mourn we muſt for ſin, either here ſavingly, if we willingly undertake it, and frame our hearts to it; or hereafter eternally and helliſhly, as hath been ſaid. And it is a diſpoſition not only ſuch as befits the <hi>times,</hi> it being the time of <hi>Jacobs trouble,</hi> and of the Churches miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in many parts of the world, but all ſorts and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men and women.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Kings and great ones</hi> who are tenderly brought up, may ſeem (if any) moſt of all exempt; yet behold <hi>David</hi> a King <hi>watering his couch with his teares;</hi> King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> turning to the wall and weeping; but above all, King <hi>Joſiah humbling himſelf, rending his clothes, and weeping before the Lord, Why?</hi> Though to other men they be as <hi>gods,</hi> yet to God whom by their ſin they offend, they are but <hi>men;</hi> and it is the great God they are to deal withall, and who will deal with them as well as with others, ſeeing he is no reſpecter of perſons.

Its here declared that <hi>they ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>and to the reſt, but firſt to</hi> Peter. <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Pope in ſpeciall manner to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, and thence to have a primacie and ſuperiority over all Churches, do here catch at the placing of a word and name, to prove <hi>Peters</hi> authority over the reſt of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">They ſpeak firſt to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  </note> as if becauſe theſe Jewes do all turn themſelves unto him, therefore hee muſt needs be chief, a leader and guide to all the reſt: Which they would gather alſo, becauſe <hi>Luke Acts</hi> 1.13. and in his Goſpel, and ſome of the other Evangeliſts naming all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles together, make mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> and name him in the firſt place. But what of this? In other Scriptures we find <hi>James</hi> named before him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>John</hi> alſo who was the beloved Diſciple, and at meat, was next to Chriſt, leaning on his boſome the very night he was betrayed, whom <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf uſed as his ſpokeſman unto Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 13.23, 24, 25. So <hi>the Diſciples</hi> are named before <hi>Cephas</hi> by the Angel <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.7. But were they therefore ſuperiour to <hi>Peter?</hi> Our adverſaries will deny that. If the naming of him after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them maketh not againſt his ſupremacy, then the ſetting of his name before them maketh not for it.<note place="margin">for ſpeciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> In this place there was a ſpeciall reaſon for it. <hi>Peter</hi> it was who deeplieſt charged them, and by conviction of them troubled their conſciences; he was the chief (though not the only) ſpeaker, and he was therefore firſt and chiefly ſpoken to, and his advice and counſell asked. Howſoever, grant <hi>Peter</hi> were firſt in reſpect of order among them,<note place="margin">An Order may be granted, but no Supremacy.</note> yet what is this to that <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> and ſuperioritie, that power and authority which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:30329:147"/>aſcribe unto him above the reſt, as if he were any more or immediatly Chriſts Vicar then the reſt? No, Chriſt gave none of them ſuch authority over other, but expreſly forbade it in them, ſaying, <hi>But ye ſhall not be ſo.</hi> We conclude then that the proud <hi>Pope's</hi> claim from <hi>Peter</hi> will afford him little power or lordly authority over his brethren.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> here, though firſt named, is but one among the reſt, among many unto whom theſe alſo ſpake as well as to <hi>Peter; For they ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>and to the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>]</p>

If thou then (or whenſoever thou ſhalt) be wounded in like caſe, conſult and ſay, <hi>Come and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will binde us up: After two daies will he revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight,</hi> Hoſ. 6.1, 2. If God (by his word) do wound,<note place="margin">If he help not, all other help is in vain.</note> it is in vain to ſeek to any other for cure: when he is diſpleaſed, who can afford help if he deny it? reſolve therefore if thou muſt periſh, (as thou art ſure enough to do, if God ſave not) to die before the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of his mercy, he may ſave thee though in ſeeming thine enemy; at leaſt if he do not, no other can; imitate the Lepers of whom we have heard, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.4, 5, &amp;c. But if being wounded in conſcience, thou ſeek to any of the aforeſaid uncomfortable means, thou ſo forſakeſt the fountain of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and with <hi>Cain</hi> fleeſt from the preſence of God. <q>Thus do many, who (as one ſaith well) as they beleeve without repenting, (and therefore their faith is preſumption) ſo they repent without beleeving, and therefore their repentance is deſperation. They mutter and murmure, and are like the chaffe which when it is ſhaken, flutters in the face of the fanner, as angry with him (as thoſe Jews <hi>Acts</hi> 7. flying in <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> face:) but the godly are as great wheat falling down at the feet of the fanner; as theſe converts here, humbling
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:30329:150"/>to <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
                  <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And ſo we come to the <hi>third relation</hi> which may be conſidered between theſe <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſome of theſe Jewes, if not all.</p>

Many butchers and cooks may be found, who uſe men like beaſts, hating the good, and loving the evill, who pluck off their skin from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones,

I am ſure more mercy may be expected from ſavage beaſts then from ſuch men as are animated by the ſpirit of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet. Which makes me remember a ſtory of an old Indian wife among the <hi>Americans,</hi> where Spaniſh cruelty did ſo far rage, as that among other cruelties whereby they deſtroyed many millions of men, whileſt their converſion was pretended, they would hound great maſtive dogs, trained up and fed with mans fleſh for the ſame purpoſe, to pull in pieces and devour whom they pleaſed of the Indians; this poor old woman being ſent on an errand with a letter through the fields, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a maſtive dog uſed to devour, was ſent out and hound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, to make his maſters ſport, in ſeeing the poor woman rent in pieces by the dog, but ſhee falling down before the dog, and according to her ſillineſſe intreating her good maſter (ſo ſhe called the dog) to ſpare her, for ſhe was going ſuch an errand, the ſavage dog ſhewed her more mercy then his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would have had him, and would not hurt the woman.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why? and How? Our ſouls are loſt,</note>Now this is the caſe of us all by nature; <hi>we are all in this ſame condemnation:</hi> Our ſouls are already loſt; we are all ſignified by the <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi> and <hi>loſt groat,</hi> as having firſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſtrayed from God, and loſt him, his face and favour, as alſo our ſelves: which we daily do more and more by our actuall ſins againſt the Law, which bring us under the curſe of the ſame: but eſpecially (whileſt we ſpeak of us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) by our impenitencie and unbeleef, which bring us under the condemnation thereof.<note place="margin">John 3.18.</note> By ſins of the firſt ſort we ſell our ſouls, and bring our ſelves under the curſe and guilt of eternall damnation; which is by profaneneſſe: But by ſins of the ſecond ſort, whereby we, through our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or wilfulneſs, make no uſe of the means appointed in mercy, and afforded us of God in and by Chriſt, which are <hi>faith</hi> in him,<note place="margin">and only ſaved by repentance and faith in Chriſt,</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 3.16, -36. and <hi>repentance, Luk.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. we through impenitency and infidelity, and ſo through our own default ſuffer our ſouls to periſh eternally in and through the guilt of ſins, for whoſe redemption and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eternall Son of God in our nature paid a ſufficient ranſom in and by the price of his own blood: ſo that whileſt we make light account of Chriſt, we are in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Jews who crucified him (for we <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.) before they came to ſee and be convinced of that their ſin: which when once they ſaw, they then (and not before) began to ſhew their care of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſouls from wrath deſerved, and of coming into a better eſtate and condition by Chriſt. And doubtleſs, till we in like manner ſee our own guiltineſs, and the curſe of God due unto us, and nothing but certain damnation whileſt we live in ſecurity, ſenſuality, unbelief and impenitency, our ſouls and the ſalvation of them from wrath deſerved, will be the leaſt part of our care.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">through a ſight of our miſery.</note>Oh then, deer brethren and ſiſters, be all convinced (and the Lord in mercy convince you) of your loſt condition, of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:30329:161"/>the damned and deſperate caſe in which you all are whileſt you live in your ſins without hearty ſorrow or repentance, and without true faith in Chriſt, who came to ſeek and find that which is loſt.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Note, previous to the other.

Thus was it here: <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Where they are as men diſtreſſed, grievouſly and inwardly pained, whoſe ſores throb and rage; or as men invironed with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or ready to drown, crying out, Help, for the Lords ſake, we are ready to periſh, and know not how to help our ſelves: <hi>Peter</hi> gives them vent by breaking the ſore, by further prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, calling them to repentance and faith; <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaith he, &amp;c. So when the <hi>Jaylour,</hi> in like diſtreſſe and ſtraits, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be-ſaved? Paul</hi> delivers him out of his ſtraits; <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Jeſus Christ, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe.</hi> Thus faithfull Miniſters (as ſent of God) afford ſuccours, and, as it were, reach out the hand to draw diſtreſſed ſouls out of the pit and gulf of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:30329:166"/>dangers. Its an eaſie thing to throw a ſtone, a jewel, or a mans ſelf into a pit, but the great difficulty is how to get it or him out againe: This, in the caſe of ſinners requires help from heaven, and ſuch was the eſtate of all mankind through the ſin of our firſt Parents (which was ſo eaſily and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light committed) that unleſſe God had become man,<note place="margin">Its an eaſie thing to deſtroy a mans ſelf, as we ſee in the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     </note> man could never have known what to have done, no more then the Divels now, who being left to themſelves, periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope.

And Gods courſe is, before he ſave from ſin and wrath his elect, to let them ſee their own caſe and helpleſs condition: only in that, and in all other temptations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he is pleaſed <hi>to make a way to eſcape,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. by opening ſome door of hope to them, but that wholly out of themſelves.

                  <p>But now, where in ſuch ſtraits and convictions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience men doe not betake themſelves to ſuch like courſes of repentance,<note place="margin">Impenitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons exclude themſelves from mercy,</note> faith, prayer, &amp;c. but thinke to wraſtle it out by their own ſtrength or other meanes, they ſhut the door of mercy againſt themſelves, and caſt themſelves into ſtraits inextricable, and ſuch as wherein they periſh; as the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cain,</hi> who in ſuch ſtraits built him a city, unto which, but not unto the Lord, he betook him for ſafety; and as <hi>Iudas</hi> who in like caſe ſought to the High Prieſts, but not to Chriſt

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader; Thou wilt perceive that in the whole Treatiſe of <hi>Compunction,</hi> I take but little notice of the times in which it is publiſhed, or of the preſent affaires, feares, diſtractions, commotions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our own Nation, and of other the Kings Dominions, which yet draw the thoughts as of our own ſo of all other nations (both Popiſh and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, who are much concerned therein, according as the iſſue ſhall prove) and doe open their eares to liſten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Newes, and to obſerve what God will doe with us, whom laſt of all he hath now brought upon the Stage, and as it were into the <hi>field,</hi> making us a bloody ſpectacle of civill, uncivill, if not unnaturall war to the whole world.</p>
               <p>In which regard, a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> meerly of this nature, may ſeem leſſe welcome or ſeaſonable, whileſt men of all ſorts, eſpecially of our own Nation, moſt what, (as is alſo fit) do ſtudy the times, and cannot willingly hear, read, or muſe on any thing (though otherwiſe neceſſary and uſefull) but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, books, and paſſages of that nature; which doe ſo wholly take up and fill all preſſes, that many, otherwiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and uſefull Books and Arguments, can ſcarce preſſe through the croud, or get paſſage into the view of the world;
<pb facs="tcp:30329:213"/>the Preſſe, as I am informed, not being at leiſure ſo much as formerly it hath been,<note place="margin">Anno 1640, 1641.</note> for the Holy Bible it ſelf, at leaſt fewer Bibles ſold, by ſome thouſands in the year, theſe two laſt yeers then in more quiet times formerly.</p>
               <p>Now though I, for that time and more, have, by Gods providence, been made a Spectator only, (and that afar off) of my native countries troubles and diſtractions, and as my calling at <hi>Dantzick</hi> required, have applied my ſtudies and labours, to the particular neceſſities, capacities and fitneſs of my hearers, yet I would not now be thought wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, (not to ſpeak of our ſympathizing here with our own Country, and with the neceſſities of <hi>Ireland</hi> (ſince the breaking out of that horrid Rebellion there) on the publike Faſt-daies in our ſmall congregation:) who formerly, for ſo many yeares, during the time of my liberty and miniſtery in <hi>New-caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi>

Unto which theſe unkindly diſſentions, and the ſword now drawn amongſt us, do invite, yea neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate and call us. For doth not <hi>the Lord of hoſts in this our day, call to weeping and to mourning, to baldneſs, and to girding with ſack-cloth?</hi> And is it ſtill a time for <hi>joy and gladneſs, ſlaying oxen,</hi> &amp;c. without looking to God, ſeeing <hi>it is a day of trouble and of treading down, and of perplexity, by the Lord God of hoſts in the valley of viſion?</hi> Iſai. 22.5, 11, 12, 13. Is it not a time to be <hi>afflicted, and to mourn and weep?</hi> and that we <hi>humble our ſelves in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> Jam. 4.9, 10. <hi>and under the mighty hand of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 5, 6. For may wee not (as formerly propheſie, ſo) now ſay <hi>A ſword, a ſword is ſharpned, and alſo furbiſhed.

               <p>Good uſe may be alſo made of the example of King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.

The foundation of which loſſe was laid in his own time, though it were not effected till his ſon <hi>Rehoboam</hi> began to reign, who in a ſuit of relaxation made to him by the people, forſaking the counſell of the old men that ſtood before <hi>Solomon</hi> his father, and following the advice of yong men, and anſwering his people roughly, he ſo occaſioned the revolt of ten Tribes, whileſt only two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him.</p>
               <p>Now if from ſuch effects already felt, or from our danger and feares of worſe, we would unpartially look into like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we ſhould ſoon ſee what need there were of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, contrition and godly ſorrow; without which it is in vain by the uſe of any other meanes, or by truſting to an arm of fleſh, to expect peace, quietneſs or ſafety.</p>
               <p>This is the only way, as it may concern our own Nation at this time to diſappoint the Romiſh Church of their hope, as it is expreſſed in the late brief or Bull of diſpenſation of the Pope to his Sonnes in <hi>England.</hi>
